# Adaptive-traffic-signaling
Our topic aims to explore the fact of adaptive traffic signaling in cities. Often, it is noticed that the signal stays red even after people have crossed, to avoid this, this model has been made.
#### Problem Statement:
Traffic congestion is a problem in the recent years in various cities which leads to wasted time, higher fuel consumption further leading to pollution and unnecessary stress. Traditional traffic signals operate on fixed timings, which don't adapt to real-time conditions. This inefficiency not only causes delays but also makes it harder for emergency vehicles to navigate through intersections quickly.
 #### Why is this project important ?
 Efficient traffic management impacts everyone- from daily commuters to emergency responders. By creating a system that adapts to real-time traffic, we can save time, reduce pollution, and make roads safer and more efficient. This project focuses on blending technology with real-world needs to tackle a problem that affects millions everyday.
#### How it solves the problem:
 Our project uses AI and web developement to create a smarter traffic management system. 
 The work is divided as :
 1. AI:- ML models analyze traffic density data to dynamically adjust signal timings, ensuring smoother traffic flow.  Emergency vehicle detection is also powered by AI, allowing signals to prioritize them.
 2. Web Developement:- A user-friendly web interface displays real-time traffic conditions, signal timings and system performance. This dashboard ensures transparency and allows for easy monitoring and future customizations. This system reduces idle times, saves fuel, and ensures emergency vehicles can respond faster- all while being scalable.
    ### What have we done ?
    We have made a 4 lane road simulation for this project using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. Now, the work of the AI is to detect the video streaming provided by the sensor on roads about the vehicles which will tell us the change in signal according to suggest timer and the speed of each step of the persons crossing the road, speed of vehicles. Our main motive is to prevent wastage of time while crossing further ensuring lesser fuel consumption and prioritising emergency vehicles by using the data of accidents in all states of india over the past 4 years (2018-2022) which will determine traffic density. Finally, we have used dummy data to predict the average fuel consumption and prioritisation for emergency vehicles. We have tried to combine both AI and Web developement through Backend (Python).
